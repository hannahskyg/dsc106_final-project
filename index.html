                <h3>And... Wealth is Growing</h3>
                <p>Between 2019 and 2022, the average American household saw their net worth increase. The overall mean household net worth rose from around $750,000 to over $1 million—a significant jump of nearly 40%.</p>
                <p>This period included the COVID-19 pandemic, stimulus payments, and a booming stock and housing market.</p>

                <h3>But... Not Everyone Benefits Equally</h3>
                <p>When we break down the data by the sex of the household head, we see disparities. Male-headed households consistently show higher average net worth than female-headed households in both years.</p>
                <p>While both groups experienced growth, the gap between them remains substantial.</p>

            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <h3>Age Tells a Different Story</h3>
                <p>Looking at age groups reveals an even more complex picture. Middle-aged households (ages 45-64) hold significantly more wealth than younger or older households.</p>
                <p>Young households (under 35) have dramatically lower net worth, while older households (65+) show moderate levels—likely reflecting retirement asset drawdowns.</p>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <h3>Education: The Great Divider</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the starkest contrast appears when examining education levels. Households headed by someone with a college degree have net worth several times higher than those without.</p>
                <p>This education gap widened between 2019 and 2022, suggesting that recent economic gains disproportionately benefited the more educated.</p>

                <h3>Therefore... Inequality Persists</h3>
                <p>While the overall picture shows growth, the benefits of economic expansion are unevenly distributed across demographics. Gender, age, and especially education create significant wealth divides.</p>
                <p>Understanding these patterns is crucial for addressing financial inequality in America.</p>

        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p><b>What have you done so far?</b></p>
        <p>We've implemented a scrollytelling narrative that guides viewers through the "and, but, therefore" story of household net worth changes. The visualization transitions between overall trends, sex-based comparisons, age groups, and education levels as you scroll.</p>
        
        <p><b>What was challenging?</b></p>
        <p>Integrating smooth scrollytelling transitions with D3.js visualizations required careful coordination between scroll position detection and chart updates. Creating meaningful groupings for age and education data while maintaining clear narratives was also complex.</p>
