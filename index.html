            <h3>Wealth is Growing… or is it?</h3>

            <!-- NOMINAL -->
            <p class="nominal-text">
                Between 2019 and 2022, the average American household saw their net worth increase significantly in nominal terms.
            </p>

            <!-- REAL -->
            <p class="real-text">
                Although nominal net worth increased between 2019 and 2022, inflation eroded much of the gain.
                In real terms (inflation-adjusted), wealth grew far less — suggesting households did not become as wealthy
                as it appears. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 1 -->
        <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <h3>But... Not Everyone Benefits Equally</h3>

            <p class="nominal-text">
                Breaking down the data by sex reveals disparities. Female-headed households experienced a smaller nominal increase in net worth than male-headed households.
            </p>

            <p class="real-text">
                After adjusting for inflation, the gender gap widens. Real net worth grew far more for male-headed households 
                than female-headed households, showing unequal financial resilience across genders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 2 -->
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <h3>Age Tells a Different Story</h3>

            <p class="nominal-text">
                Middle-aged households (45–64) hold significantly more nominal wealth than younger or older households.
                Younger households (under 35) have far lower net worth.
            </p>

            <p class="real-text">
                Inflation-adjusted trends show that younger households lost even more ground.
                While older and middle-aged groups preserved more real wealth, younger households' real net worth improved only minimally.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 3 -->
        <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <h3>Education, the Problem</h3>

            <p class="nominal-text">
                Households with lower education levels have significantly less nominal net worth.
            </p>

            <p class="real-text">
                When adjusted for inflation, all different kinds of educational level had a decrease for networth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 4 -->
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
            <h3>Therefore... Inequality Persists</h3>

            <p class="nominal-text">
                Despite overall nominal growth, the gains of economic expansion remain uneven across gender, age, and education.
            </p>

            <p class="real-text">
                When we adjust for inflation, inequality becomes even more visible.  
                Real wealth growth is concentrated among older, male, and highly educated households — 
                widening disparities across the population.
