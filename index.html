        <p><b>What have you done so far?</b></p>
        <p>
            At the moment, we have created and published our GitHub page with our first interactive visualization. We have integrated our first interactive visualization by using d3 to import two datasets from 2019 and 2022 and create a chart that compares the mean U.S. Household net worth between the two years. To make it interactive and more detailed for getting started with the scrollytelling, we implemented a filter checkbox that changes the bar chart to visualize based on the sex of the household head. We also have some simple styling/CSS down to get started with making the website more appealing to the audience.

        <br><p><b>What will be the most challenging part of the project to design and why?</b></p>
        <p>
            The most challenging part of the project design would be figuring out how to integrate scrollytelling. We like the idea of using scrollytelling to visualize our dataset, but this is something that we just learned and are not familiar with yet. In addition, we don’t have a super clear narrative/story to tell since we want to compare with all the demographics and need to figure out how to transition between them all. The best way to transition between them would be the animation supporting the scrolling, which we also just learned, and would be challenging.
