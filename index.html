                <h3>Wealth is Growing..  or is it?</h3>
                <p>Between 2019 and 2022, the average American household saw their net worth increase. The overall mean household net worth increased significantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="1">
                <h3>But... Not Everyone Benefits Equally</h3>
                <p>When we break down the data by the sex of the household head, we see disparities. Looking at the change, female households have a smaller change in networth than males households.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <h3>Age Tells a Different Story</h3>
                <p>Looking at age groups reveals an even more complex picture. Middle-aged households (ages 45-64) hold significantly more wealth than younger or older households.</p>
                <p>Young households (under 35) have dramatically lower net worth, while older households (65+) show moderate levels—likely reflecting retirement asset drawdowns.</p>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <h3>Education, the Problem</h3>
                <p>When examining education levels, households headed by someone with someone of a high school degree or less had less networth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="4">
                <h3>Therefore... Inequality Persists</h3>
                <p>While the overall picture shows growth, the benefits of economic expansion are unevenly distributed across demographics. Gender, age, and education create significant wealth divides.</p>
                <p>Understanding these patterns is crucial for addressing financial inequality in America.</p>
