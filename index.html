    <h1>Did people get richer after COVID!?</h1>
    <h2>US Households' Financial Situation Pre- and Post-COVID Across Different Demographics</h2>
    <p>By: Hannah Gonzalez, Edwards Tong, Janie Chan, and Junran Yang</p>

    <h3>📉 Economic Shock and Unequal Impact (2019-2022)</h3>
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic created an economic shock unlike anything in decades. From 2019 to 2022, U.S. households experienced <strong>dramatic and deeply unequal changes</strong> in their financial situation.</p>

    <p>Several key forces shaped this challenging period, directly impacting the financial stability of many:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inflation rose sharply,</strong> severely eroding the <strong>purchasing power</strong> of wages and the real value of savings for everyday Americans.</li>
        <li><strong>Job losses hit unevenly,</strong> disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, including <strong>women, younger workers, and less-educated households.</strong> This created immediate financial distress.</li>
        <li>While asset prices surged and interest rates were low, these benefits primarily accrued to the wealthy, <strong>exacerbating the financial gap</strong> for those struggling to afford basic necessities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The result was a period of <strong>deepening inequality.</strong> Although total national wealth increased, the growth was <strong>not distributed evenly.</strong> Many groups barely kept up with inflation, and the most vulnerable were severely challenged by job insecurity and rising costs.</p>

    <p>This analysis traces how wealth changed across different demographics to reveal <strong>who was left behind</strong> by the pandemic's uneven economic effects.</p>

            <h3>Wealth is Growing… or is it?</h3>
            <p class="nominal-text">Between 2019 and 2022, the average American household saw their net worth increase significantly in nominal terms.</p>
            <p class="real-text">Although nominal net worth increased, inflation eroded much of the gain. Real wealth grew far less than it appears.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="1">
            <h3>But... Not Everyone Benefits Equally</h3>
            <p class="nominal-text">Female-headed households experienced a smaller nominal increase than male-headed households.</p>
            <p class="real-text">After inflation adjustment, the gender gap widens: male-headed households gained more real wealth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="2">
            <h3>Age Tells a Different Story</h3>
            <p class="nominal-text">Younger age households increased more in net worth than middle age and older households.</p>
            <p class="real-text">Proportionally, the younger age households had a larger increase in net worth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <h3>Education, the Problem</h3>
            <p class="nominal-text">Households with lower education levels have significantly less nominal net worth.</p>
            <p class="real-text">After inflation adjustment, all education levels experienced net worth decreases.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step" data-step="4">
            <h3>Therefore... Inequality Persists</h3>
            <p class="nominal-text">Despite overall growth, gains are uneven across gender, age, and education.</p>
            <p class="real-text">Real wealth growth is concentrated among older, male, and highly educated households, widening disparities.</p>
